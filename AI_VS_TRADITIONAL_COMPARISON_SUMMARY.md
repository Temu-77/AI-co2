- **High Resolution** (> 4MP): Premium/4K ads

### **Traditional Process Modeling**
Each tier includes realistic traditional design workflows:

#### Low Resolution (‚â§ 1MP)
- Design Time: 3 hours
- Revisions: 2 cycles
- Stock Photos: 1
- Photoshoot: No
- Total CO‚ÇÇ: ~1,100g

#### Medium Resolution (1-4MP)  
- Design Time: 6 hours
- Revisions: 3 cycles
- Stock Photos: 2
- Photoshoot: No
- Total CO‚ÇÇ: ~1,850g

#### High Resolution (> 4MP)
- Design Time: 12 hours
- Revisions: 4 cycles
- Stock Photos: 3
- Photoshoot: Yes (studio, equipment, travel)
- Total CO‚ÇÇ: ~4,900g

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- AI: Model details and generation time
- Environmental savings with specific metrics

## üå± Environmental Impact Calculations

### **Traditional Process CO‚ÇÇ Sources:**
1. **Designer Labor**: 150g CO‚ÇÇ/hour (computer + office)
2. **Revision Cycles**: 30% of original time per revision
3. **Stock Photos**: 50g CO‚ÇÇ per photo (licensing/download)
4. **Photoshoots**: 2,500g CO‚ÇÇ (studio, equipment, travel)
5. **Computer Usage**: 200-800g CO‚ÇÇ (software intensive work)

### **AI Process Benefits:**
- Instant generation (~30 seconds)
- No human labor CO‚ÇÇ
- No photoshoot requirements
- Minimal revision cycles
